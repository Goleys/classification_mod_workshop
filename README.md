# classification_mod_workshop
The base classification tutorial was developed by the Intel Corporation and modified by Diego Abad. Since our workshop needs a "simple to demonstrate" exercise, I decided that I would use the previous tutorial and modify it to create a fun activity and an introduction to what OpenVINO can do.
